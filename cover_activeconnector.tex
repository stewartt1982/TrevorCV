\noindent{To Whom It May Concern:}
\newline
\newline
\noindent{My background is in both computer science (BCS) and physics (BSc, MSc, PhD).  I have spent my professional career to this point in academia, specifically in the field of experimental particle physics.  The main 3 experiments that I have worked on are as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ZEUS experiment (DESY, Hamburg, Germany)
  \item T2K experiment (Tokaimura, Ibaraki/Hida, Gifu, Japan)
  \item Hyper-Kamiokande (Tokaimura, Ibaraki/Hida, Gifu, Japan)
  \end{itemize}
Due to this background I am proficient in advanced data analysis (data sets in the multi-TB size range), mathematics, statistics and computing (programming, data structures, algorithms, etc.).  Due to the nature of how modern particle physics experiments collect and analyze their data, I am an experienced programmer in C/C++, Perl, Python, FORTRAN and have experience with a number of other languages.  Through my roles as calorimeter expert on ZEUS, DAQ expert and Run-Coordinator on the T2K experiment I am extremely proficient in maintaining/upgrading/operating complex scientific equipment.  Additionally I have gained experience in R\&D via the Hyper-Kamiokande data acquisition system, starting from scratch, to proof of concept, to a tested and functional system.  Finally, I have significant experience giving presentations on my own and colleagues work to a variety of audiences, from peers at major scientific conferences, to the general public at laboratory open days and tours.

\noindent{I have recently decided to make the move from academia to private industry, primarily due to a wish for a more permanent position (particularly a position in Japan) rather than moving countries/continents every 2-3 years as a postdoctoral researcher.  Given my background in data analysis, computer science/programming, and scientific mindset, I am primarily interested in data science/analysis/engineering roles.  While many of my skills are transferable to these types of positions, I have been making a study of the python data science stack (ie. numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc).
