Postdoctoral Research Associate\\/Rutherford Appleton Laboratory \hfill June 2013 to January 2018\\
{\bf T2K}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
\item Highly involved in the operation and maintenance of the T2K data acquisition system hardware and software and T2K run coordination.
\item Developed a selection for charged current anti-neutrino $\pi^{-}$ events in an anti-neutrino beam at T2K.
\item In charge of data distribution on the GRID and maintaining of data distribution software.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Hyper-Kamiokande}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
\item Research into the requirements needed for the data acquisition system for the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector.
\item Development of trigger algorithms for the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, concen-trating on triggers to lower the low energy threshold of the detector.
