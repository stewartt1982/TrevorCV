\section{RESEARCH INTERESTS}

My research has chiefly focused on high-$Q^2$ neutral and charged current deep inelastic scattering and charm production.  However, I am interested in a wide range of topics in high energy experimental particle physics, especially those that can be studied at the LHC: Higgs and new physics beyond the standard model (BSM) searches and precision QCD and electroweak measurements.  

At ZEUS, my main experience with detector hardware has been the calorimeter and the trigger.  While both of these are of great interest to me, I would also like to gain experience with the operation of other detector components such as muon or tracking detectors.

\section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}

Graduate Student \hfill March 2006 to present\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed an analysis for charm production in charged current deep inelastic scattering analysis using reconstructed secondary verticies and impact parameter techniques.  This analysis was the first observation of charm production in charged current deep inelastic scattering at ZEUS by this technique.
\item Developed an analysis for high-$Q^2$ neutral current $e^{+}p $ deep inelastic scattering using the HERA polarised positron beam.  This analysis measured the single differential cross-sections, the reduced cross-sections, observed parity violation at high-$Q^2$ and in combination with the previously published HERA-II $e^{-}p$ analysis, made the most precise determination of $xF_3^{\gamma Z}$.  
\item Measured the shape of the $Z_{vtx}$ distribution for the 2006-2007 positron running period at ZEUS.  Showed the need for multiple $Z_{vtx}$ measurements within the running period.  Implemented a correction based on this measurement.
\item Worked on validating the common ntuple (CN) project at ZEUS  using both the charm production in charged current analysis and the neutral current analysis.  The goal of the CN project is to provide ntuples suitable for a wide range of analysis and long term storage of ZEUS data.
\item Contributed to the running, maintenance and calibration of the ZEUS calorimeter. 

\end{itemize}

Summer Research Assistant \hfill May 2005 to August 2005\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuation of work on the ZEUS Third Level Trigger.
  \item Studied the effects of backsplash from the ZEUS calorimeter on the measurement of the kinematic variables using jets.  Implemented this correction for use in high-$Q^2$ neutral current deep inelastic scattering.
\end{itemize}

Summer Research Assistant \hfill May 2004 to August 2004 \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Assisted with the maintenance, operation, debugging and updating of the ZEUS Third Level Trigger (TLT).
