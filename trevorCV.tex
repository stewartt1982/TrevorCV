\section{PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY}
Experienced researcher in experimental particle physics with experience working on a number of experiments both running and in development.  Have worked on several cross-section analysis on the ZEUS detector and T2K detectors.  On the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector performed studies on the requirements for a data acquisition and trigger system, and software development for detector simulations.  Strong background in computer science, with experience in a number of different computer languages.  Solid skills in physics analysis, mathematics, statistics and algorithms.  Experience in managing a team of researchers through activities as data acquisition expert and run coordinator on the T2K experiment.  

\section{WORK HISTORY - RESEARCH}
Postdoctoral Research Associate \hfill June 2013 to present\\
\textbf{T2K}
\begin{itemize}
\item Highly involved in the operation and maintenance of the T2K data acquisition system hardware and software and T2K run coordination.
\item In charge of data distribution on the GRID and maintaining of data distribution software
\item Developed a selection for charged current anti-neutrino $\pi^{-}$ events in an anti-neutrino beam at T2K.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Hyper-Kamiokande}
\begin{itemize}
\item Study requirements needed for a data acquisition system for the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector.
\item Development of trigger algorithms for the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, concentrating on triggers to lower the low energy threshold of the detector.
\item Software development work on WCSim to allow more flexible implementation of digitisation of analogue signals and trigger systems.
\end{itemize}
Graduate Student \hfill March 2006 to present\\
\textbf{ZEUS}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed an analysis for charm production in charged current deep inelastic scattering analysis using reconstructed secondary vertices and impact parameter techniques.  This analysis was the first observation of charm production in charged current deep inelastic scattering at ZEUS by this technique.
\item Developed an analysis for high-$Q^2$ neutral current $e^{+}p $ deep inelastic scattering using the HERA polarised positron beam. 
\item Measured the shape of the $Z_{vtx}$ distribution for the 2006-2007 positron running.  Showed the need for more careful treatment of the $Z_{vtx}$ measurement for future analyses.
\item Worked on validating the common ntuple (CN) project at ZEUS for long term data storage.
\item Contributed to the running, maintenance and calibration of the ZEUS calorimeter and high level Third Level Trigger. 
\end{itemize}
Summer Research Assistant \hfill May 2005 to August 2005\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on the ZEUS Third Level Trigger.
  \item Studied the effects of backsplash from the ZEUS calorimeter on the measurement of the kinematic variables.
\end{itemize}
Summer Research Assistant \hfill May 2004 to August 2004 \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Assisted with the maintenance, operation, debugging and updating of the ZEUS Third Level Trigger. 
\end{itemize}
